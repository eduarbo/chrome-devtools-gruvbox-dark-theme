# Gruvbox Dark Theme for Chrome Devtools
Gruvbox Dark is a retro groove color scheme for Chrome DevTools. This is a port
of the Vim version originally by [Pavel Pertsev](https://github.com/morhetz)
found [here](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

By now it's only a dark theme, I'm working in the light version too.

Stable and Canary channels are officially supported.  Beta and Dev channels will work, but I'm not testing on them.

➡ Please follow development for this theme at [chrome devtools themes](https://github.com/eduarbo/chrome-devtools-themes).

## Installation

* Add [Gruvbox Dark](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtools-theme-gruvbox-da/njcgdakjdifgccdgnoiphpnihcfopcmj) from the Chrome Web Store.
* Open Chrome devtools settings and check "Allow extensions to load custom stylesheets".
* Reload Chrome
